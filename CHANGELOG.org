* 1.0
** Features
*** New and improved guid available in doc/user-guide.org!
*** New CLONE* macro
**** :accessor can be used now, and is preferred. :manipulator is deprecated.
**** with-accessors works (it did before, too), not just with-manipulators.
**** CLONE* works more like DEFCLASS*. It auto-generates accessors unless told not to do so.
**** DEFSHEEP now uses CLONE* instead of CLONE.
*** Updated API -- no longer exporting some symbols, and exporting other new ones
*** Sheep locking
    Sheep can be locked by doing lock-sheep/unlock-sheep/toggle-sheep-lock
*** Undefinition works different
    Message/buzzword undefinition no longer works as before. Undefbuzzword does not remove roles, it
    simply removes the buzzword from the global table and makes the function unbound.
*** Improved AVAILABLE-MESSAGES
    the function now helpfully returns a list of vectors. The first entry is the buzzword name, the
    second is the position the sheep can participate in.
*** UNDEFBUZZWORD removed
** Bugs
*** Made next-messages ignorable. Compilers should no longer warn about it.
*** There was a bug in CCL with ensure-buzzword complaining about :documentation
*** Added another check to CLONE. Can no longer have :reader/:writer/:accessor as nil, as well as define one.
*** MITOSIS works a bit more like expected, but still doesn't recursively copy collections.
*** UNDEFMESSAGE works correctly, after some minor hiccups.

* 0.9
** Features
*** HUGE optimization for message dispatch.
*** Property-access is no longer cached -- setfing was way too expensive.
    It will stay thing way unless I figure out a good lazy-update scheme.
*** Property-access itself is a little faster now, too
** Bugs
*** Shit wasn't updating properly before, so bugs could crop up with deep hierarchies.
*** Little stability tweaks here and there. Doesn't break as often :)
*** Buzzwords with no arglist work now (snort)
*** Buzzword redefinition now checks for lambda-list consistency with existing messages.

* 0.8
** Features
*** Significant speedup for message dispatch, using a simple caching system.
** Bugs
*** &allow-other-keys is no longer necessary when using &key args with buzzwords.

* 0.7
** Features
*** Can now define messages on initialize-sheep and reinitialize-sheep
*** Message lambda-list congruence now follows the same rules as CLOS:
    http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/07_fd.htm
** Bugs
*** buzzwords with &key, &rest, etc, actually work now
*** some mostly-inconsequential whoopsies with conditions were patched

* 0.6
** Features
*** Nothing worth noting
** Bugfixes
*** defsheep wasn't actually redefining sheeple.
*** Lots of minor bugfixes

* 0.5
** Features
*** Cloneforms actually work more like CLOS initforms now
    (they don't execute if a value is already provided)
*** Major, faster reimplementation of Sheeple. The MOP stuff is gone for now, though.
** Bugfixes
*** Conditions work nicer now. Reorganized them and put them in their place.

* 0.4
** Features
*** Several MOP-related symbols made available, including sheep creation and property access.
*** More information about Sheeple in README
** Bugfixes
*** Fixed a bug with undefbuzzword that undefined all messages

* 0.3
** Features
*** CLOS-style lambda-lists for buzzwords and messages implemented
*** Updated README to reflect new defbuzzword
*** More tests written -- all pass on SBCL/Lin32
** Bugfixes
*** Fixed issue with message blocks
*** Fixed issue caused by fixing issue with message blocks

* 0.2
** Features
*** with-properties and with-manipulators implemented
*** small code cleanup
*** New tools for inspecting and manipulating cloneforms
*** Property access speedup -- all property keys must now be symbols
** Bugfixes
*** NIL

* 0.1
