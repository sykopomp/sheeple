* 0.9
** Features
*** HUGE optimization for message dispatch.
*** Property-access is no longer cached -- setfing was way too expensive.
    It will stay thing way unless I figure out a good lazy-update scheme.
*** Property-access itself is a little faster now, too
** Bugs
*** Shit wasn't updating properly before, so bugs could crop up with deep hierarchies.
*** Little stability tweaks here and there. Doesn't break as often :)

* 0.8
**Features
*** Significant speedup for message dispatch, using a simple caching system.
**Bugs
*** &allow-other-keys is no longer necessary when using &key args with buzzwords.

* 0.7
** Features
*** Can now define messages on initialize-sheep and reinitialize-sheep
*** Message lambda-list congruence now follows the same rules as CLOS:
    http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/07_fd.htm
** Bugs
*** buzzwords with &key, &rest, etc, actually work now
*** some mostly-inconsequential whoopsies with conditions were patched

* 0.6
** Features
*** Nothing worth noting
** Bugfixes
*** defsheep wasn't actually redefining sheeple.
*** Lots of minor bugfixes

* 0.5
** Features
*** Cloneforms actually work more like CLOS initforms now
    (they don't execute if a value is already provided)
