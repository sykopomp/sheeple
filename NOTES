<zkat> tcr: is there a way to add custom indentation/highlighting rules to slime? custom
    inspection stuff?
<tcr> zkat: Depends on what you mean by that. For inspection, you can specialize on
    SWANK::EMACS-INSPECT. It uses a very easy sexp-based markup scheme
<tcr> zkat: There's some initial work for setting indentation information from Common
    Lisp in contrib/swank-indentation.lisp.  
<tcr> zkat: No you implementation should provide such a hook for M-. See
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/313242
<tcr> zkat: if you use slime-fontifying-fu, all form beginning with a symbol like
    define-foo are fontified the same as defun is fontified
