* DONE Write a replace-sheep function
  it should swap a sheep's properties/contents with a new 'definition',
  while maintaining identity.
* DONE Wrap replace-sheep with a DEFSHEEP macro.
* TODO Write unit tests for defsheep
* TODO Work out the whole conditions thing, and what they print out. Put them all in conditions.lisp?
* TODO Write plenty more unit tests. Even unit tests for unimplemented features.
* DONE Optimize the shit out of property-access
  Done for now -- it's only slightly slower than PCL right now
* TODO Allow individual message documentation
* DONE Optimize the shit out of message dispatch
  Fast enough for now. Again, only a few times slower than PCL.
* TODO Implement :message option for defbuzzword (like CLOS' :method option)
* TODO Complete documentation with tutorial and user's guide
* TODO Thoroughly test sheeple, make sure everything's stable
* TODO Make sure user's guide and documentation is good, then make it better
