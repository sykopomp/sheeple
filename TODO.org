* TODO Later
** TODO Implement :message option for defmessage (like CLOS' :method option)
   I don't care about this feature all that much, so I might just keep bumping it until someone
   who -does- care asks for it.
   UPDATE: I don't think I even want this. It makes the defmessage macro horribly bloated and
   complex, and I don't even like the idea of stuffing everything into a message definition. Things
   need to stay flexible, and this would be just plain ugly.
** TODO Make singly-dispatched readers just about as fast as simply calling property-value
** TODO Write caching scheme for property access.
   I should've done this in the first place. A simpler version of the same system used to dispatch
   messages would do wonders for read performance, without seriously harming writer performance.
** TODO Write more unit tests.
*** TODO Fix unit tests now that undefinition works different...
    OHGOD THEY ALL BROKE
*** TODO Write unit tests for defsheep 
*** TODO Write unit tests for new LL stuff
*** DONE Write more thorough tests to make sure caching schemes aren't broken
    Honestly? The existing tests check this well enough.
*** TODO Write a "many many messages" test
*** TODO Write more tests with multi-level hierarchy lists
*** TODO (Re-)write unit tests for locked properties.
* TODO 2.0
  Sheeple gets serious -- and more useful. The version jumps because this will completely
  break backwards compatibility with all previous sheeple code.
** DONE New interface
*** DONE CLONE -> function
    CLONE should be turned into a very simple function: (clone &rest sheep)
*** DONE CLONE* -> DEFCLONE
    What is currently CLONE should be renamed to DEFCLONE. More involved cloning capabilities
    are still nice.
*** DONE DEFSHEEP->DEFPROTO
    Time to get a bit more serious. DEFPROTO is a much clearer name.
*** DONE Mitosis->copy-sheep
    Also, get it working properly.
*** DONE defbuzzword -> defmessage
    Rename this thing. It really doesn't have to be silly.
*** DONE defmessage -> defreply
    I think I could get used to this naming scheme instead.
*** DONE Fleeced Wolf -> Boxed built-in
*** DONE =white-fang= -> boxed-object
*** DONE Fleecing -> Autoboxing
** DONE Make psheep easier to implement
*** DONE The order in which a sheep is built needs to be planned out more carefully.
    UPDATE: I think this is just about ready. Should probably think about this for a while first,
    and then it'll be done.
    UPDATE: I think this is good enough. It's straightforward.
** DONE More cleanup and convenience
*** DONE Get rid of add-on-write. Require add-property.
    Add-on-write seems like a quick interface, but it's a bit obnoxious to deal with.
    Not only does it create a risk for some serious hard-to-track bugs, but it makes
    it trickier to allocate space for properties when using the MOP.
*** DONE Shallow-copy/deep-copy should not be options.
    These are stupid, and they clutter up the interface. Never used them, never had to.
    Deep-copy could be its own function, under a different name, but it's easy enough
    to implement externally -- I'll see if it's ever used by anyone.
*** DONE Completely remove cloneforms
*** DONE Make nicknames generic properties?
    Or something similar. Would be nice to have some pointer as to what type an object is.
    UPDATE: Not for this version. This can be done later.
*** DONE Put prototypes into their own namespace
    CL is a lisp-n. Classes, functions, variables, are all stored in different namespaces.
    Thus, even though there isn't much of a difference between regular objects and prototypes,
    prototypes defined with defproto should be dumped into their own namespace, and the =foo=
    naming scheme should be dropped as a convention.
    Implementing this is simply a matter of having a hash-table of symbol->object mappings
    (the same way find-class works). The Sheeple counterpart of find-class would be find-proto.
    UPDATE: This is mostly done. Just gotta make sure everything works properly.
*** DONE Fix reinitialize-sheep
    This should be modeled more after reinitialize-instance. i.e. it should be specified
    that its function is to update the parents and direct property values of its sheep argument.
    UPDATE: A better definition is "resets the sheep's parents with a list of new parents, and
    wipes out all its direct properties from the map."
*** DONE Implement something like Io's slotSummary
    This is really important! :-o
    UPDATE: direct-property-summary and property-summary should do the trick for now :)
    UPDATE: It actually works now. And it's fucking sexy.
** DONE Sheeple is horribly broken -- fix it
   At this point, it's probably a better idea to go over all of sheeple again, bit by bit,
   and reimplement things as necessary. Try to clean up the interface and all that.
   Dispatch is completely broken, but it's probably due to reply definition. It might also
   have been caused by all the damn renaming I did all over the place. I really never learn
   my lesson.
   Ah well, there goes the rest of my week.
   UPDATE: Woo, it seems to work now!
** TODO Tests
   All these changes should have a completely new set of unit tests written for them.
   While I'm at it, this could be an opportunity to improve the structure of the tests,
   and improve overall test coverage. They're broken right now, anyways. Ah well :\
   Do not tag and release 2.0 until all tests are written, and pass.
** TODO Fix bugs
   The tests should oust a bunch of bugs. Fix them.
** TODO Rewrite documentation
** DONE Rewrite examples
** TODO Figure out init-sheep
   Where should it go? What should it do?
   It would be nice if it was called -after- properties were
   added when using defclone/defproto. Or maybe the standard
   reply should add property-definitions handed to spawn-sheep
   by defclone/defproto?

* DONE 1.1
** DONE Rewrite sheeple using CLOS  
** DONE Expose enough of a MOP for psheep to be able to do its thing.
** DONE No-arg buzzwords don't work. Fix it.
** DONE Document new MOP features
* DONE 1.0.1
** DONE Allow individual message documentation
** DONE Add CLONE/CLONE*/DEFSHEEP :documentation option
** DONE Write a small sample application
   This will really help me iron out any last details in the API that are important enough to have
   there before 1.0 ships. Plus, it's silly to release shit without even trying it...
   I thought it would be a good idea to convert yashmup, but the current approach of simply renaming
   everything doesn't work, because of the behavior of prototypes, and the setup I had for classes
   (which was pretty awful).
   What I should do instead is start a different project, based on yashmup, but coded in sheeple
   from the bottom up.
   UPDATE: There's been lots of progress since I started working on UID. Tagging this as done (for now)
** DONE Document code
    Note: I can use stuff from the user's guide for this, but it's important.
    UPDATE: it's documented enough (for now).
** DONE Fix the fucking :around message dispatch bullshit.
   THERE. DONE. FUCK.
** DONE Dispatching messages with things like strings or numbers creates a new wolf every time.
   This is pretty terrible. I should at least fix stuff so that fleeced wolves are created only
   when necessary.
   Note: Fleeced wolves only need to exist if there are messages defined on them. Thus, if a message
   is dispatched, it first checks if there is a wolf created for that built-in type. If not, it
   can just find its built-in 'parent'.
   This is such a horrible source of memory leakage.
* DONE 1.0
** DONE Complete documentation
*** DONE Write proper user guide
*** DONE Update guide
** DONE Fix any bugs unit tests come up with
*** DONE Oops -- CLONE should check that defining an accessor first, then passing it NIL is also an error
*** DONE Undefmessage really isn't doing what it's supposed to.
    All tests pass, too!
** DONE Finalize API
   No (significant) changes allowed to API until 2.0, after this release.
*** DONE Do I want to make CLONE work more like defclass*?
    That might be good. It would not be incompatible with older versions of Sheeple, either.
*** DONE Deprecate :manipulator?
    I should deprecate :manipulator in favor of :accessor, since with-accessors will work on both
    CLOS and Sheeple. :accessor is much nicer... I'll remain compatible for now.
*** DONE Go through src/packages.lisp and figure out how much I actually need right now.
*** DONE Should I shut off access to stuff like undefbuzzword/undefmessage?
    Undefbuzzword definitely gone, undefmessage staying for now.
*** DONE (De-)(Re-)implement property objects, allow them to be lockable
    Actually, I think I should get rid of property-objects and make it just so an entire sheep can
    be locked at once.
    UPDATE: All set. Sheeple are now locked as a whole.
*** DONE Forgot MITOSIS >_>
    lol, no I didn't -- but it needed to be fixed anyway
*** DONE Is a :copy-on-clone option for individual properties better than :cloneform for most purposes?
    No.
*** DONE Need a way to list all messages that a sheep can participate in
    LOLOLOLO I ALREADY DID THIS XD XD XD
*** DONE Finalize everything when all else is done.
** DONE Fucking get rid of all these optimization declarations.
   One of these days I'll learn to heed my own fucking advice
* DONE 0.9
** DONE More optimization
   The goal here is to have manipulator dispatch be at a maximum 2x slower than property-value. If I
   can get it as fast as direct property-access, even better, but this shit can go so much faster
   without too much magic.
   Update: currently down to just under 10x slower for single dispatch vs direct property access
   Update: make that 5x slower. ;)
   Update: Sped up (setf property-value) a bit. I'm going to have to make a decision about what
   needs to be faster here -- perhaps I'll find out once I write some apps.
   Update: Caching property-owners was silly, and became incredibly expensive
   Update: Will stop optimizing after manipulators are optimized to an acceptable speed.
   Update: 5x really isn't that bad. I'm going to keep it for now.
** DONE Convert CHANGELOG to .org
** DONE Redefining buzzwords
   It would be really nice if buzzword-redefinition followed the same rules as CLOS
   Update: Good enough for now. It warns about shit.
* DONE 0.8
** DONE Optimize the shit out of message dispatch
   It's pretty fast right now, but nothing compared to PCL.
   I should read through the Slate paper again and see if I can implement any of their
   suggested optimizations.
   Additionally, I found a paper that talks about how PCL's caching works. I think I can
   implement something similar in sheeple, which would then make message dispatch absurdly fast.
   One word: MEMOIZATION. Do it.
   Memoization done, but profiling shows that there's other stuff in the way (such as the
   numerous calls to remove-if-not -during- dispatch time. Shit.
   As far as this remove-if-not, etc stuff goes -- I think I can figure out some fancy
   message-list caching system. The problem is that make-message-lambda might get confused, and
   I want to avoid changing stuff outside of message-dispatch.lisp as much as possible.
   There will be a time in the future when heavy-optimization and code-uglying will be appropriate.
   But for now, while the system is still being designed, it's best to keep things clean and
   flexible (and slow...).
   UPDATE: New caching system has made shit run hella-fast. According to sb-sprof, the next step
   would be to have a nicer hashing scheme, since using a list and using equal to fetch stuff from
   a hash table isn't really very speedy. For now, though, this will do! :) (haven't really tested
   this too much, though. Hm.)
** DONE Fix lambda-list keyword things
* DONE 0.7
** DONE Make initialize-instance a buzzword so :after messages can be defined
   both initialize-instance and reinitialize-instance are regular buzzwords now.
** DONE Have buzzwords accept &keywords in lambda lists, and maintain congruence as per CLOS
   This seemed to be working, but I have to put &allow-other-keys in all methods in order for it
   to work, which is sub-optimal. This can be fixed, and I should do it by 0.8
   UPDATE: Fix'd in make-message-lambda :)
* DONE 0.6
** DONE Write a replace-sheep function
  it should swap a sheep's properties/contents with a new 'definition',
  while maintaining identity.
** DONE Wrap replace-sheep with a DEFSHEEP macro.
** DONE Optimize the shit out of property-access
  Done for now -- it's only slightly slower than PCL right now
** DONE Work out the whole conditions thing, and what they print out. 
   Put them all in conditions.lisp?
* DONE 0.5
** DONE Get all pre-0.6 done by 0.5
