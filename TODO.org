* Convenience
** DONE Write a replace-sheep function
  it should swap a sheep's properties/contents with a new 'definition',
  while maintaining identity.
** DONE Wrap replace-sheep with a DEFSHEEP macro.
* Documentation
** TODO Allow individual message documentation
** TODO Complete documentation with tutorial and user's guide
** TODO Make sure user's guide and documentation is good, then make it better

* Performance
** DONE Optimize the shit out of property-access
  Done for now -- it's only slightly slower than PCL right now
** DONE Optimize the shit out of message dispatch
  Fast enough for now. Again, only a few times slower than PCL.

* Fancy features
** TODO Implement :message option for defbuzzword (like CLOS' :method option)

* Stability
** TODO Write unit tests for defsheep



** TODO Work out the whole conditions thing, and what they print out. 
   Put them all in conditions.lisp?
** TODO Write plenty more unit tests.
   I need to write unit-tests for the defsheep stuff, at least.
** TODO Thoroughly test sheeple, make sure everything's stable
