;; Here's a translation of the bank account code from PCL, into Sheeple
;;
;; Things to note:
;; * No advanced method combination
;; * No need for class allocation (can simply keep data in prototype)
;; * No real distinction between classes and objects.
;; * No equivalent of :INITFORM. All properties start off 'initialized' with whatever value the
;;   nearest parent set. Getting :INITFORM-like behavior requires writing replies for the
;;   INIT-SHEEP message.
;; * Message definition is on actual objects, not on classes.
;; * The hierarchy list for sheep works identically to CLOS's class precedence list (same sorting)

;; The defproto macro is really just a wrapper around sheep creation that handles redefinition in a
;; convenient way that fits more nicely with Lisp-style development. DEFPROTO should be used
;; for prototypes that are meant to be part of the text code, while clone should be used for
;; anonymous objects.
;; There is no difference between the actual objects that DEFPROTO and SPAWN create,
;; DEFPROTO is purely convenience for defining code more concisely and precisely,
;; and for interactive development.
