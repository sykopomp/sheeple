;;; We need to construct the following objects:

;;;          Object        |      Metaobject       |    Parents
;;; -----------------------+-----------------------+---------------
;;;           =T=          | =STANDARD-METAOBJECT= |     NIL
;;;    =STANDARD-OBJECT=   | =STANDARD-METAOBJECT= |    (=T=)
;;;  =STANDARD-METAOBJECT= | =STANDARD-METAOBJECT= |    (=T=)

;;; We only want to bootstrap an image once, so we perform a little check:
(unless (objectp =standard-metaobject=)

  ;; First, let's just get our objects:
  (setf =standard-metaobject= (std-allocate-object =standard-metaobject=)
          =standard-object=   (std-allocate-object =standard-metaobject=)
                 =t=          (std-allocate-object =standard-metaobject=))

  ;; Now, we have to hardcode two circular links.

  ;; =STANDARD-METAOBJECT= is its own metaobject. This link isn't created above
  ;; because '=STANDARD-METAOBJECT= is bound to junk before boot, so we fix
  ;; this manually now.
  (setf (%object-metaobject =standard-metaobject=) =standard-metaobject=)

  ;; =T= has a one-object hierarchy list, just itself. Hierarchy lists usually get
  ;; cached whenever an object's mold changes; however, because objects start out
  ;; pointing at the "null mold", and =T= remains pointing at this mold, we need
  ;; to fix =T='s %object-hierarchy manually.
  (push =t= (%object-hierarchy =t=))

  ;; Now, focus on the family!
  (push =t= (object-parents =standard-object=))
  (push =t= (object-parents =standard-metaobject=))

  ;; To finish up, break the ice by playing the name game:
  (macrolet ((set-name (name) `(setf (property-value ,name 'nickname) ',name)))
    (set-name =t=)
    (set-name =standard-object=)
    (set-name =standard-metaobject=)))
