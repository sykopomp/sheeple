;; TODO:
;; * Add an option that prevents an object from being edited?
;; * Add a property metaobject for more tweaked property options
;; * Add property option that works like :initform
;; * Add property option to copy individual properties
;; * Add property option that forces all descendants to copy a property
;; * Clone option to auto-generate all accessors (with optional appending?)
;; * Write more unit tests
;; * Keep cleaning and testing until it's stable
;; * Documentation!!
